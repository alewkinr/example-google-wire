# example-google-wire

This repository contains experiments with [google/wire](https://github.com/google/wire) generation tool in terms of
dependency injection simplification.

A couple of stages are implemented via commits:

1. Demonstration of the initial state of the project with a lot of boilerplate code.
2. Demonstration of the first stage of simplification with the help of `wire`.
